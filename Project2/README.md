# Hello professor and git hub community. This is my second project 2 for my scripting class and I tried to create a snake game with the help of TokyoEdTech and my peer classmates that outputs the game. For your reference I used module from the global API which has a function. I hope you all enjoyed my code and if you have any questions or concerns let me know.
